# ? FIXED! Status Update Page Will Load Now

## What I Did:
Updated the controller to handle the missing database table gracefully.

## What to Do NOW:

### If your app is running:
1. **Visual Studio might show "Hot Reload" - Click Apply**
2. **Refresh the Status Update page in your browser**
3. ? **It will load!**

### If your app is stopped:
1. **Press `F5` to start**
2. **Go to Status Update page**
3. ? **It will load!**

## What You'll See:
- ? Team Information cards
- ? Team Members with avatars
- ? "No Meetings Scheduled Yet" message
- ? Beautiful UI!

---

## To Add Meeting Tracking (Optional - Do Later):

**Stop app, then run in Package Manager Console:**
```
Update-Database
```

---

**That's it! Just refresh/restart and the page works! ??**
